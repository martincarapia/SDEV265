This Project is called "Risk-it Ralph," a Discord Bot that aims to bring more fun, excitement, and friendly competition to your Discord server!

Although in the early stages of development and without any code scripted yet, this project will offer a variety of gambling-type and casino-style games. It will allow users to bet, wager, win, and lose virtual currency in a safe, non-harmful, and family-friendly way. 

This project being centered around the Python Coding language, Risk it Ralph will feature the following:

*  Classic casino games like Blackjack, Roulette, and Slots.
*  A custom currency system where players can earn and wager tokens.
*  Leaderboards and achievements to show off your winning streaks.
